 * This file contains declarations for the various structs forming the abstract syntax tree for spl.
 * Due to the fact that C requires all structs to be declared before being used, each header file would have to declare all structs it uses.
 * To avoid repetition, all declarations are placed in this header file.
 * All other header files defining the structures then include this file to have all declarations available.
